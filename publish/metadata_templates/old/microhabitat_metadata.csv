channel_geomorphic_unit,"Geomorphic features of stream designated through visual observation. Features include = c(""glide"", ""glide margin"", ""pool"", ""riffle"", ""riffle margin"", ""backwater""). A glide is characterized by its smooth, uniform flow and relatively shallow depth. A riffle is a shallow section where the flow of water is faster and more turbulent. A pool is characterized by deeper depth, slower flow, and relatively calm water. A backwater area is characterized by stagnant or slow-moving water often found in area where the main flow is obstructed. Riffle or glide margins are transitions between these geomorphic units.",text,,,,
